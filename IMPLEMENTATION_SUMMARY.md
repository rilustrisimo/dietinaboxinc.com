# Meal Plans Mockup Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Successfully Implemented & Fixed**

### **🐛 Issues Fixed**

#### **1. Double Border Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Items had double borders from nested containers
- **Solution**: Added CSS rules to remove borders from nested `.container` and `.row` elements
- **Code**: `border: none !important; padding: 0 !important; margin: 0 !important;`

#### **2. Background Color** ✅
- **Problem**: Page background didn't match mockup
- **Solution**: Added template-specific background color
- **Code**: `.meal-plans-modern #primary.content-area { background-color: #f8fafc; }`

#### **3. Image Size** ✅
- **Problem**: Images were too small (4rem x 4rem)
- **Solution**: Increased to 5rem x 5rem for meal plans, improved responsive sizing
- **Mobile**: Scales down appropriately (4rem → 3.5rem → 3rem)

#### **4. Font Weight Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Fonts weren't bold enough for titles, calories, and prices
- **Solution**: Enhanced font weights throughout
  - **Page Title**: `font-weight: 900`
  - **Meal Names**: `font-weight: 700`
  - **Calories**: `font-weight: 700`
  - **Prices**: `font-weight: 800`

#### **5. Item Count Alignment** ✅
- **Problem**: Quantity indicators were misaligned and not showing properly
- **Solution**: Fixed positioning and visibility logic
  - **CSS**: Proper absolute positioning with `.show` class
  - **JS**: Added `.addClass('show')` and `.removeClass('show')` logic

#### **6. Price Calculation Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: Prices had comma separators causing NaN errors
- **Solution**: Enhanced price parsing in multiple ways:
  - **Template**: Removed commas from data attributes: `str_replace(',', '', $v['variant_price'])`
  - **JavaScript**: Robust price parsing: `parseFloat(price.replace(/[₱,\s]/g, ''))`
  - **Fallback**: Multiple fallback methods for price detection

#### **7. Order Summary Sticky & Layout** ✅
- **Problem**: Order summary wasn't sticky and had layout issues
- **Solution**: 
  - **Sticky**: `position: sticky; top: 2rem;`
  - **Max Height**: `max-height: calc(100vh - 4rem); overflow-y: auto;`
  - **Mobile**: `position: static` for smaller screens

#### **8. Responsive Design** ✅

## 🎯 **Template-Specific Styling Implemented** ✅

### **Complete CSS Scoping Applied**

To ensure that the meal plans styling only affects this specific template and doesn't interfere with other pages, comprehensive scoping has been implemented:

#### **1. Template-Specific Body Classes**
- Added `meal-plans-template` body class via PHP filter
- Added `page-template-meal-plans-dev` for additional specificity
- Template includes unique container ID: `#meal-plans-development`

#### **2. Conditional CSS Loading**
```php
// Only load meal plans modern CSS for the specific template
if ( is_page_template( 'template-shop-dev.php' ) ) {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'meal-plans-modern', get_template_directory_uri() . '/meal-plans-modern.css', array('custom-style'), '1.0');
    wp_enqueue_style( 'fontawesome', 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css' );
}
```

#### **3. Highly Specific CSS Selectors**
Every CSS rule is prefixed with template-specific selectors:
- `body.meal-plans-template` - Main body class selector
- `#meal-plans-development` - Unique container ID selector
- `body.page-template-meal-plans-dev` - WordPress template class
- `body.page-template-template-shop-dev` - Fallback template class

#### **4. Example Scoped Selector Structure**
```css
/* BEFORE (Global) */
.meal-plan-card { ... }

/* AFTER (Template-Specific) */
body.meal-plans-template .meal-plan-card,
#meal-plans-development .meal-plan-card { ... }
```

#### **5. Complete Scoping Coverage**
✅ **All 1100+ lines of CSS** are properly scoped
✅ **No global selectors** that could affect other pages
✅ **Conditional loading** - CSS only loads on this template
✅ **Multiple layers of specificity** for maximum isolation
✅ **FontAwesome** also conditionally loaded only for this template

#### **6. Benefits of This Approach**
- **Zero interference** with other pages and templates
- **Performance improvement** - CSS only loads where needed
- **Maintainability** - Easy to identify template-specific styles
- **Future-proof** - Can be easily modified without affecting other pages
- **WordPress best practices** - Follows conditional loading patterns
