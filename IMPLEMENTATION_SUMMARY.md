# Meal Plans Mockup Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Successfully Implemented & Fixed**

### **🐛 Issues Fixed**

#### **1. Double Border Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Items had double borders from nested containers
- **Solution**: Added CSS rules to remove borders from nested `.container` and `.row` elements
- **Code**: `border: none !important; padding: 0 !important; margin: 0 !important;`

#### **2. Background Color** ✅
- **Problem**: Page background didn't match mockup
- **Solution**: Added template-specific background color
- **Code**: `.meal-plans-modern #primary.content-area { background-color: #f8fafc; }`

#### **3. Image Size** ✅
- **Problem**: Images were too small (4rem x 4rem)
- **Solution**: Increased to 5rem x 5rem for meal plans, improved responsive sizing
- **Mobile**: Scales down appropriately (4rem → 3.5rem → 3rem)

#### **4. Font Weight Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Fonts weren't bold enough for titles, calories, and prices
- **Solution**: Enhanced font weights throughout
  - **Page Title**: `font-weight: 900`
  - **Meal Names**: `font-weight: 700`
  - **Calories**: `font-weight: 700`
  - **Prices**: `font-weight: 800`

#### **5. Item Count Alignment** ✅
- **Problem**: Quantity indicators were misaligned and not showing properly
- **Solution**: Fixed positioning and visibility logic
  - **CSS**: Proper absolute positioning with `.show` class
  - **JS**: Added `.addClass('show')` and `.removeClass('show')` logic

#### **6. Price Calculation Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: Prices had comma separators causing NaN errors
- **Solution**: Enhanced price parsing in multiple ways:
  - **Template**: Removed commas from data attributes: `str_replace(',', '', $v['variant_price'])`
  - **JavaScript**: Robust price parsing: `parseFloat(price.replace(/[₱,\s]/g, ''))`
  - **Fallback**: Multiple fallback methods for price detection

#### **7. Order Summary Sticky & Layout** ✅
- **Problem**: Order summary wasn't sticky and had layout issues
- **Solution**: 
  - **Sticky**: `position: sticky; top: 2rem;`
  - **Max Height**: `max-height: calc(100vh - 4rem); overflow-y: auto;`
  - **Mobile**: `position: static` for smaller screens
